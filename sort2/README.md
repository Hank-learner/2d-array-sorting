# Quick sort
getting array and inputting to the split function<br>
a value in the array,last number is taken as the pivot to the array and stored in a variable<br>
corresponding to the number,the elements to the left of it are smaller and right of it is bigger like wise sorted using the for loop
inside the loop if the number in the right is bigger it leaves as it is and if it is in its left the element checks weteher it is lesser or not if its greater it swaps the value on its side till it moves let of the element in the array <br>
the elements are swapped using the if condition ,if the element of the array is less than or equal to the pivot value hence sorting the array<br>
